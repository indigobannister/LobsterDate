### Data & Methods
Data for California spiny lobster abundance and size along the Santa Barbara Coast, 2012-2018, were collected by the [Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research group](https://sbclter.msi.ucsb.edu/). Data was collected annually at five long term kelp forest study sites. Two of the sites were located within Marine Protected Areas (Naples and Isla Vista) and three were outside of a MPA (Arroyo Quemado, Mohawk and Carpinteria). Lobsters were counted and sizes estimated visually by divers in late summer before fishing season began. For more information on the methods, see the project [metadata](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/metadataviewer?packageid=knb-lter-sbc.77.3). Mean lobster size (mm) was compared for 2012 and 2018 at the non-MPA and MPA sites by two-sample t-tests ($\alpha$ = 0.05 throughout). In addition, mean lobster size was compared  pre-MPA (2012) and post-MPA (2018). All analyses and figures were prepared using R software version 3.6.1.

\

### Results

#### 1. Annual lobster abundance by site, 2012-2018
**Analysis:** Figure 2 demonstrates varying trends in lobster abundance among the 5 collection sites. At Isla Vista and Naples, both located within Marine Protected Areas, lobster abundance trends positive after the MPAs were established in 2012. Both MPA sites saw spikes in 2015, and declines in 2016 followed by increases in population. At non-MPA sites, counts are highly variable and characteristics between sites are not shared. At Arroyo Quemado, lobster counts remained relatively stable over the studied time period. At Carpinteria, a major spike in lobster abundance (2017) was followed by a major decline (2018). At Mohawk, a spike in abundance in 2015 gives way to stability into 2018.

#### 2. Lobster size: 2012 to 2018
```{r}
# Create two dataframes filtered for size analysis, one for lobster size data in 2012 and the other for 2018
lobster_2018 <- lobster_clean %>% 
  select(year, size_mm, site_name) %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(2018))

lobster_2012 <- lobster_clean %>% 
  select(year, size_mm, site_name) %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(2012))

# Create two dataframes with calculated medians for lobster size in 2012 and 2018 at each site
lobster_2018_med <- lobster_2018 %>% 
  group_by(site_name) %>% 
  summarize(median = median(size_mm))

lobster_2012_med <- lobster_2012 %>% 
  group_by(site_name) %>% 
  summarize(median = median(size_mm))
```
**Analysis:** Figure 3 depicts size abundance trends amongst lobsters in 2012 and 2018 at the five collection sites. Both sites that established MPAs in 2012 (Isla Vista and Naples) had more larger lobsters by 2018 than they did when the MPAs were established. Median sizes for Isla Vista lobsters increased from  (`r lobster_2012_med$median[1]` mm to `r lobster_2018_med$median[1]` mm), while median sizes for Naples lobsters increased from (`r lobster_2012_med$median[2]` mm to `r lobster_2018_med$median[2]` mm).

Lobster sizes at the non-MPA sites stayed relatively stable across the time duration with median sizes not shifting greatly.

In 2012, mean lobster size differed significantly between MPA (m = `r round(size_ttest_2012$estimate[1], 2)`) and non-MPA (m = `r round(size_ttest_2012$estimate[2], 2)`) sites (t(`r round(size_ttest_2012$parameter, 2)`) = `r round(size_ttest_2012$statistic, 2)`, *p* = `r round(size_ttest_2012$p.value, 4)`), with a moderate effect size (`r round(cohen_2012$estimate, 2)`). This suggests a smaller mean lobster size (95% confidence interval = `r round(size_ttest_2012$conf.int, 4)`) at MPA sites vs non-MPA sites in 2012.

In 2018, mean lobster size also differed significantly between MPA (m = `r round(size_ttest_2018$estimate[1], 2)`) and non-MPA (m = `r round(size_ttest_2018$estimate[2], 2)`) sites (t(`r round(size_ttest_2018$statistic, 2)`, *p* `r ifelse( 0.001 > size_ttest_2018$p.value, "< 0.001", paste("= ", round(size_ttest_2018$p.value, 2)))`), with a small effect size (`r round(cohen_2012$estimate, 2)`). This suggests a smaller mean lobster size (95% confidence interval = `r round(size_ttest_2018$conf.int, 4)`) at non-MPA sites vs MPA sites in 2018.

Between MPA sites, we do see a significant difference in mean lobster sizes between 2012 (m = `r round(ttest_MPA$estimate[1], 2)`) and 2018 (m = `r round(ttest_MPA$estimate[2], 2)`), (t(`r round(ttest_MPA$parameter, 2)`) = `r round(ttest_MPA$statistic, 2)`, *p* `r ifelse( 0.001 > ttest_MPA$p.value, "< 0.001", paste("= ", round(ttest_MPA$p.value, 4)))`), with a large effect size (`r round(cohen_MPA$estimate, 2)`).

Between non-MPA sites, we do not see a significant difference between mean lobster size between 2012 (m = `r round(ttest_nonMPA$estimate[1], 2)`) and 2018 (m = `r round(ttest_nonMPA$estimate[2], 2)`). Therefore we do not have sufficient evidence to say that we should reject the null hypothesis that mean lobster size is the same (t(`r round(ttest_nonMPA$parameter, 2)`) = `r round(ttest_nonMPA$statistic, 2)`, *p* `r ifelse( 0.001 > ttest_nonMPA$p.value, "< 0.001", paste("= ", round(ttest_nonMPA$p.value,2)))`), with a negligible effect size (`r round(cohen_nonMPA$estimate, 2)`).
